records_request = """This is a public records request to every PRA covered-entity in Washington State (see https://realtimclemans.com/my-epic-records-requests-bot-plan-and-proposal-for-over-hauling-washington-states-out-dated-public-records-act/) made by CollectorBot on behalf of dataabout.me.

This is one bot records request in a 24 hour period. Because I am a bot I can not use a portal such as GovQA and demand all responses be in text format not PDF/Word and that records be disclosed as zip files via email attachment (not GovQA attachment) or direct link to the zip file that doesn't require logging in
 
I demand all records be electronically redacted. Absolutely do not print out or scan anything.
