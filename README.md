What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.
We're both a transparency and privacy company. The five things we offer:
* Identity and personal information discovery, disclosure, and verification: Authorized third parties can use our system to ensure a customer or employee candidate is who they say they are and is safe to do business with and government agencies and hospitals can use our system for virtual identification like virtual drivers licenses and querying by name, alias, government IDs, birthday, and biometrics such as face, DNA, and fingerprint if they record their entire investigation with a camera, provide us the video for auditing, and their staff follow the law. Once we have millions of dollars in funding we will use the PayPal strategy of paying people to submit high quality face images, fingerprints, and DNA of themselves and their children. This will significantly improve law enforcement's ability to solve crimes and for hospitals to retrieve accurate information about unconscious patients.
* Record people and organization's entire lives, store the data securely with no-knowledge of the contents by encrypting and decrypting it client side using a strong password the customer has memorized, hasn't written down, only enters on secure devices, and doesn't use anywhere else, back up the data to multiple clouds and provide customers with hard drives of the data. This will greatly help people with Alzheimer's and other memory disorders. Organizations will be able to prevent policy and law violations using our recording technology and system that prevents improper digital behavior. We will provide a market place where our customers can sell their data and we get a 30% fee.
* Free public profiles of people and organizations with all verified government and publicly available data: To add information to a profile one must be a paying customer and either the person or authorized representative. People/organizations with poor reputations can explain past behavior and how they have changed their lives/organizations for the better. The public can post constructive feedback and verified information about the person or organization. It will let profile owners post messages, blog posts, and sell stuff.
* OAuth API for organizations that pass our security, privacy, ethics, and regulatory compliance review: Secure authentication with strong memorized password not used elsewhere and mandatory app based two-factor authentication and get all the information they need with notification to customer of data collection and usage explanation
* Secure privacy respecting open-source app platform: Third party developers will be able to make useful open source apps for our customers. We'll secure the apps and run them on our cloud platform and take responsibility for security, privacy, usability, regulatory compliance, and support and take a 40% fee on subscription fees and 10% of all other revenue. App developers don't get access to raw personal/business data. This is in direct response to a Facebook app developer selling personal data to Cambridge Analytica. Some app ideas I have include private censorship-free social networks where all the data is encrypted with each user in the network's public cryptography key, frugal.help which helps people get out of debt and be frugal, and fail log where people track their failures and write how to avoid them in the future.

PROGRESS
How far along are you?
I have a pretty good idea how to implement this now after a lot of thinking. So far I have email verification with Recaptcha V2 forced image matching setup. Next step is creating password creation and identity verification with government ID and webcam video.

How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.
A few days. About 20 hours.

Are people using your product?
No

When will you have a prototype or beta?
1 week

Do you have revenue?
No

If you are applying with the same idea as last batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?
If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.

IDEA
Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?
Spider Oak, LifeLock, LastPass, Clearview AI, Lexis Nexis, Google, Wikipedia, Whatsup, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Linkedin, Twitter, ProtorU, Spokeo, Zillow, Ring, Wyze

What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?
Facebook and other companies with APIs just don't get that providing personal data to untrusted third parties is ripe for disaster.

How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
(We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate.)

My goal is that we will reach one billion paying customers in seven years, one year less than Facebook. We charge a starting price of $9.99/month so that will be $119,880,000,000/year. China alone has 1.2 Billion and is obsessed with surveillance. I think China will mandate identity verification with our system. I'll charge a $1/query. So that'll be another $1.2 billion+.

How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?
Right away we're going to get paying customers who want to add information to their public profiles.


EQUITY
Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?
No

If you have not formed the company yet, describe the planned equity ownership breakdown among the founders, employees and any other proposed stockholders. If there are multiple founders, be sure to give the proposed equity ownership of each founder.
(This question is as much for you as us.)

Me 80% and 20% for late stage venture capital. I won't have investors and board until as late as possible for maximum control.

Please provide any other relevant information about the structure or formation of the company.

LEGAL
Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? If so, please explain.
No

Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.
I write all the code.

Is there anything else we should know about your company?
(Pending lawsuits, cofounders who have left, etc.)


OTHERS
If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.
Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.
(The answer need not be related to your project.)

That you can get a job by DDOSing the Seattle Police Department with records requests.



It will offer a browser plugin to autofill fields and archive web history and webpages. It will offer third parties OAuth permissions to those who pass our security and privacy review process. To solve the problem where app developers are harvesting data from sites, like Facebook via OAuth, and selling it, we'll provide a secure managed app platform where personal data is never disclosed to the app maker and we're responsible for security, privacy, safety, reliability, and accessibility regulatory compliance. We'll only provide OAuth access to big companies that can't reasonablely move to our managed app platform.

### Tim's moviation for launching DataAbout.me

I'm fed up with entering my address repeatedly, my password manager not understanding that subdomains each have their own passwords, creating secure answers to security questions, and filling out the same info for each dating site I use. I want all websites to use one authentication provider with mandatory two-factor app auth so I don't get hacked. I also want to automatically screenrecord everything on my computer especially tweets I see that get deleted. I also want my computer systems to know everything about me so they can assist me better. For example I want ads for stuff I would want to buy and have the budget for.

## Goals 
* **Eliminate indentity theft:** On sign up we'll require live webcam video of customer and photo of front and back government ID and human verification of it. Our goal is to become the sole authentication and authorization platform in the world. If a customer lost their government ID an authorized organization can look them up by entering in the info the customer provides and comparing the photos to the customer trying to be authenticated. 
* **Stop mass-surveillance:** Governments will have to get a warrant and convince the data owner to unencrypt the data. Customers are required to prove they have enabled disk encryption with Mac Filevault or Windows Bitlocker or Linux disk encryption. 
* **Accuracy:** All data submitted for storage by a third-party is digitally signed. This way hospitals can use the medical records the customer has without worrying that the customer or another party modified the records.
* **Prevent criminal, civil law, and policy violations:** Record everything and ensure that every digital action is authorized before allowing it. 
* Make it easy for app developers to launch useful regulatory compliant apps
* Give customers to ability to electronically store everything about their lives and make the data useful to them
* Allow customers to sell their data
* Enable secure online voting 

## How the site currently operates
* Data is stored on the [AWS S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html) compliant provider [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com) because of the significant cost savings. 

## Security strategy
* **Make discovery of email addresses hard:** Instead of storing email addresses in plaintext we store them as a hash with a unique salt. To prevent our system from ever seeing the customer's password the client hashes it with a salt. This way if the database where to ever get leaked we would worry less about email addresses being disclosed. This isn't foolproof becausse an attacker could try a dictionary of email addresseses. For Gmail addresses we add `+` and a 3 digit number that we tell the customer to write down in a safe place. On login attempt the server loops through each customer row hashing the unique salt and email/username
* **Never transmit the customer's password** There are two salts. One is for server-side use and the other is for client-side use. The client gets the client-side salt, hashes the password with it and sends the server the hashed password then the server hashes it with the server side salt.
* **Ban IP addresses knowned to be used by a server, proxy, residential IP rental, compromised IP, or privacy VPN company:** 
* **Make using stolen session keys hard:** Session tokens are tied to ip address and browser fingerprint to make it harder to use stolen session tokens.

## Revenue streams
* **Subscription:** $9.99/TB, a $4 markup on Wasabi 
* **Selling data with customer's permission:** 10% fee
* **App revenue fee:** 15% under $1 million and 30% over $1 million
* **OAuth fee:** A penny per unique customer authed
* **Ads on profile pages:**
* **Consulting:** We will develop secure software that works with our platform
