# DataAboutDotMe
DataAbout.me will be a for-profit provider of secure cloud data storage of personal and business data. It will offer a browser plugin to autofill fields and archive web history and webpages. It will offer third parties who pass our security and privacy review OAuth access. To solve the problem where app developers are harvesting data from sites, like Facebook via OAuth, and selling it, we'll provide a secure hosted app platform where personal data is never disclosed to the app maker and we're responsible for security, privacy, safety, reliability, and accessibility regulatory compliance.

Goals: 
* Eliminate indentity theft and release of private information
* Eliminate fraud and crime
* Make it easy for app developers to launch useful legally compliant apps
* Give users to ability to electronically store everything about their lives and make the data useful to them
* Allow users to sell their data
* Enable secure online voting 

How the site currently operates:
* Data is stored on Amazon Web Services S3. I'll switch to Wasabi because of the significant cost savings.
